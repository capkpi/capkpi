The CapKPI team and community take security issues in the CapKPI Framework seriously. To report a security issue, fill out the form at [https://capkpi.com/security/report](https://capkpi.com/security/report).

You can help us make CapKPI and consequently all CapKPI dependent apps like [ERP](https://capkpi.com) more secure by following the [Reporting guidelines](https://capkpi.com/security).

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. We'll endeavor to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process.
